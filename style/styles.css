So, it's little surprise that for anyone considering an international move, it's important to understand a country's attitudes towards work.
               To figure out which nations have the best work-life harmony, we looked at the 2023 Global Life-Work Balance Index by HR-tech company Remote, which takes into account aspects such as statutory annual leave, minimum statutory sick pay percentage and amount of paid maternity leave. We also looked at the OECD's work-life balance data, which analyses how many
                hours employees work and how much time people devote to leisure and personal care in its 22 member countries.</p>
