So, it's little surprise that for anyone considering an international move, it's important to understand a country's attitudes towards work.
                       To figure out which nations have the best work-life harmony, we looked at the 2023 Global Life-Work Balance Index by HR-tech company Remote, which takes into account aspects such as statutory annual leave, minimum statutory sick pay percentage and amount of paid maternity leave. We also looked at the OECD's work-life balance data, which analyses how many
                        hours employees work and how much time people devote to leisure and personal care in its 22 member countries.</p>

            <div class="card-body">  <h4 class="card-title">CNN</h4><p>More than 1 billion children, adolescents and adults live with obesity around the world, making it the most common form of malnutrition in many countries, according to an analysis published Thursday in the journal The Lancet.
                This staggering statistic was reached earlier than anticipated, driven in large part by the rapid transition of malnutrition in the form of underweight to obesity in low-income and middle-income countries, Dr. Majid Ezzati, senior author of the analysis and professor at Imperial College London, said in a news conference Thursday.
                Previous estimates by the World Obesity Federation suggested that there would be 1 billion people living with obesity by 2030, but that number was already surpassed in 2022, Ezzati said.</p>

                This week: two big political events: Super Tuesday and the annual State of the Union Speech by President Biden. They mark the official kickoff of the race for the U.S. Presidency. 
                A look at the continuing crisis in Gaza... NATO conducts military exercises in the Arctic, and we mark International Women’s Day…all this, today, on The Inside Story.
                In what could be the most consequential speech in his bid for re-election, U.S. President Joe Biden this week gave a feisty State of the Union speech. The speech laid out his vision for a second term. In it, he called for more humanitarian aid into Gaza and continued funding of Ukraine’s war efforts. The 81-year old also directly addressed concerns over his age. VOA's White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has more.</p>
